## Features

- **Comprehensive Validation**: Supports validation of strings, numbers, emails, dates, enums, files, and custom formats.
- **Decorator-based Validation**: Utilizes TypeScript decorators for easy and declarative validation directly in your class models.
- **Flexible and Extensible**: Easily extendable to include custom validation rules and logic.
- **Framework Agnostic**: Can be used with any server-side framework or library, such as Express, Koa, or Fastify.
- **Full TypeScript Support**: Leverages TypeScript for type safety and enhanced developer experience.
- **Custom Error Messages**: Allows defining custom error messages for each validation rule to provide clear and specific feedback.

## Installation

```bash
npm install rest-data-validator
```

Or using Yarn:

```bash
yarn add rest-data-validator
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

Basic usage involves importing the validators and applying them to your data models:

```typescript
import { ClassValidator, String, Number, validate } from "rest-data-validator";

@ClassValidator
class User {
  @String({ minLength: 3, maxLength: 30 })
  name: string;

  @Number({ min: 18 })
  age: number;
}

const user = new User();
user.name = "John Doe";
user.age = 25;

// It would return true since the conditions are met, otherwise it would throw an exception.

// And using the validator manually
const beforeDate = new Date("2024-12-31");
const afterDate = new Date("2020-01-01");

const options = { before: beforeDate, after: afterDate };
const validDateString = "2022-06-15";
const validationResult = validateDate(validDateString, options).isValid;

console.log(validationResult); // false;
```

### Using Decorators for Validation

Decorators can be applied to class properties to specify the validation rules directly in the model definition:

```typescript
import {
  String,
  Number,
  Enum,
  ClassValidator,
  validate,
} from "rest-data-validator";

enum Role {
  Admin,
  User,
  Guest,
}

@ClassValidator
class UserProfile {
  @String({ minLength: 2, maxLength: 100 })
  username: string;

  @Number({ min: 1, max: 100 })
  level: number;

  @Enum({ enum: Role })
  role: Role;
}

const profile = new UserProfile();
profile.username = "validator";
profile.level = 5;
profile.role = Role.User;
```

### Custom Validation Rules

For more complex validation scenarios, custom validators can be created and used:

```typescript
import { ValidationResult, validateCustom } from "rest-data-validator";

function customUsernameValidator(value: string): ValidationResult {
  const isValid = /^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/.test(value);
  return {
    isValid,
    errors: isValid
      ? []
      : ["Username must only contain alphanumeric characters."],
  };
}

const result = validateCustom("user123", customUsernameValidator);
console.log(result);
```
## Roadmap

The `rest-data-validator` project aims to continually evolve with the needs of developers and the dynamics of RESTful API design. Below is a tentative roadmap of features and improvements we're exploring:

### Upcoming Features

- [x] **Nested Validation Support**: Implement validation for complex, nested data structures to accommodate intricate API schemas.

- [x] **Asynchronous Validators**: Introduce validators capable of handling asynchronous operations, useful for database lookups or external API validations.

- [ ] **Internationalization**: Offer localized error messages to better serve a global user base.

- [ ] **Sanitization Enhancements**: Expand sanitization utilities for preprocessing data, ensuring robust input handling before validation.

- [ ] **Framework Middleware**: Develop middleware for seamless integration with popular server frameworks like Express and NestJS.

- [ ] **Runtime Type System Integration**: Explore compatibility with runtime type validation libraries to enhance JavaScript validation capabilities.

- [ ] **CLI Tooling**: Build CLI tools for generating validator schemas from TypeScript type definitions, aiding in rapid development cycles.

- [ ] **Plugin Architecture**: Create an extensible plugin system allowing custom validators and sanitizers, fostering community-driven enhancements.

- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Profile and optimize the core validation logic to efficiently handle large datasets and reduce overhead in high-throughput environments.

- [ ] **GUI for Schema Building**: Provide a graphical interface for constructing and exporting validation schemas, streamlining the setup process for `rest-data-validator`.

We welcome community input and contributions to help shape the future of `rest-data-validator`. If you have ideas or features youâ€™d like to see, please open an issue to start the conversation.
