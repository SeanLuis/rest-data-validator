## Features

- **Comprehensive Validation**: Supports validation of strings, numbers, emails, dates, enums, files, and custom formats.
- **Decorator-based Validation**: Utilizes TypeScript decorators for easy and declarative validation directly in your class models.
- **Schema File Provider**: Load and convert schema definitions from JSON or YAML files into validation schemas, allowing for flexible and manageable validation configurations.
- **Extensive Validation Schemas**: Offers a wide range of validation schemas to validate various data types and structures in a scalable and flexible manner.
- **Flexible and Extensible**: Easily extendable to include custom validation rules and logic.
- **Framework Agnostic**: Can be used with any server-side framework or library, such as Express, Koa, or Fastify.
- **Full TypeScript Support**: Leverages TypeScript for type safety and enhanced developer experience.
- **Custom Error Messages**: Allows defining custom error messages for each validation rule to provide clear and specific feedback.

## Installation

Npm:

```bash
npm install rest-data-validator@latest
```

Yarn:

```bash
yarn add rest-data-validator@latest
```

Pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add rest-data-validator@latest
```

### Using Decorators for Validation

Decorators provide a declarative way to add validation rules directly to your class properties.

### Custom Validation Rules

You can easily extend the library to include custom validation rules and logic.

## Schema File Provider

The `SchemaFileProvider` allows you to externalize your validation schemas into JSON or YAML files. This makes the validation process more flexible and easier to manage, especially for large or complex schemas.

### Key Features

- **Load Schemas from Files**: Load schema definitions from ```JSON``` or ```YAML``` files.
- **Convert Definitions to Schemas**: Convert loaded schema definitions into validation schemas that can be used throughout your application.

## Validation Schemas

REST Data Validator provides a comprehensive set of validation schemas to validate various data types and structures. These schemas are designed to be flexible and reusable, enabling developers to build complex validation logic easily.

### Available Schemas

- **String**: Validates string values with support for constraints like minimum and maximum length.
- **Number**: Validates numerical values with support for constraints like minimum and maximum values.
- **Boolean**: Validates boolean values.
- **Object**: Validates objects based on a schema definition for each property.
- **Array**: Validates arrays and allows setting constraints on the array's length and its elements' schema.
- **Union**: Validates a value that can match any one of the provided schemas.
- **Enum**: Validates that a value is one of a predefined set of allowed values.
- **Date**: Validates date values with support for constraints on the date range.
- **Tuple**: Validates arrays with fixed length and specific types at each index.
- **Record**: Validates objects where all keys and values match specified schemas.
- **Nullable**: Allows a value to be `null` or satisfy another schema.
- **Any**: Accepts any value without restrictions.
- **Lazy**: Supports defining schemas that are evaluated lazily, useful for recursive or conditional schemas.
- **Literal**: Validates that a value matches a specific literal value.
- **Transform**: Allows transforming the value during validation by applying a transformation function before validating.

## Rest CLI

### Commands

The CLI provides various commands to help you generate and manage validation schemas.

### Model Generation

Generate models with predefined validation rules quickly.

### Validation Generation

Add validation rules to existing models interactively.

## Validators and Decorators

- **Dependency Validators**: Ensure properties are validated based on other property values.

## Decorators Utilities

- **Accessors Decorator**: Validate properties with getter and setter accessors.
- **Getter Decorator**: Validate properties accessed via getters.
- **Setter Decorator**: Validate properties accessed via setters.

## Security Utilities

- **Security Validation**: Validate security-related properties.
- **Security Decorator**: Decorate properties with security validation.
- **Security Events**: Handle security-related events.

## Roadmap

The `rest-data-validator` project aims to continually evolve with the needs of developers and the dynamics of RESTful API design. Below is a tentative roadmap of features and improvements we're exploring:

### Upcoming Features
